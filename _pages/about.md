Hi, I am Chenwei, My research focuses on deep learning, computer vision, multimodal learning and their applications in autonomous driving or robotics. 

Previously, I was a research assistant working with [Rui Song](https://rruisong.github.io/) and [Prof. Andreas Festag](https://festag-net.de/) at [Fraunhofer IVI](https://www.ivi.fraunhofer.de/), where I worked on 3D scene understanding for autonomous vehicles. I received my Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering from [Technical University of Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/), supervised by [Zhengyang Li](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifn/institute/dept/sv/li) and [Prof. Tim Fingscheidt](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifn/institute/team/sv/fingscheidt). Before that, I received a dual Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [University of Shanghai for Science and Technology](https://en.usst.edu.cn/) and [Hamburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/).
